# Hey.
[Fox_McCloud45 from Jeuxvideo.com.](https://www.jeuxvideo.com/profil/fox_mccloud45?mode=infos)

I barely do anything here. I know a fair bit of C, C++, Java, Python, etc. I know some OS-level stuff on Windows, macOS, GNU/Linux.

I play Team Fortress 2, sometimes.

I don't really upload anything on GitHub.

You can reach me at [foxmccloud45@gmail.com](mailto:foxmccloud45@gmail.com).
